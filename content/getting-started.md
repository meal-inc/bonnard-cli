# Getting Started

> Install the Bonnard CLI, connect your data warehouse, and define your first semantic layer with cubes and views in under five minutes.

## What is Bonnard?

Bonnard is a semantic layer platform that sits between your data warehouse and your consumers (BI tools, AI agents, applications). You define your metrics and dimensions once in YAML, then query them through a consistent API.
