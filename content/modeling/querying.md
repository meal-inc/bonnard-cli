# Querying

> Once deployed, query your semantic layer three ways: MCP for AI agents, REST API for structured queries, and SDK for custom applications.

Once your semantic layer is deployed, it's queryable through three interfaces:

- **[MCP](querying.mcp)** — Connect AI agents like Claude, ChatGPT, and Cursor to explore and query your data model through the Model Context Protocol
- **[REST API](querying.rest-api)** — Send JSON query objects or SQL strings for structured, programmatic access
- **[SDK](querying.sdk)** — Build custom dashboards, embedded analytics, and data pipelines with the TypeScript client

All three interfaces query the same governed semantic layer — same metrics, same access controls, same results.
