# Slack & Teams (Coming Soon)

> AI agents in your team chat. Coming soon.

Bonnard will bring semantic layer queries directly into Slack and Microsoft Teams — so anyone on your team can ask questions about data without leaving the conversation.

## Planned capabilities

- **Natural language queries** — Ask "what was revenue last month?" in a channel and get an answer with a chart
- **Governed responses** — Every answer goes through your semantic layer, so metrics are always consistent
- **Shared context** — Results posted in channels are visible to the whole team, not siloed in individual AI chats
- **Proactive alerts** — Get notified when key metrics change beyond thresholds you define

## Why it matters

Your team already lives in Slack and Teams. Instead of asking analysts or switching to a BI tool, anyone can get instant, governed answers right where they work. The same semantic layer that powers your AI agents and dashboards powers your team chat.
