# Build & Deploy a Dashboard

This guide walks through creating an HTML dashboard powered by the
Bonnard SDK and deploying it as a hosted dashboard.

## Phase 1: Get the Starter Template

Fetch the SDK + Chart.js starter template:

```bash
bon docs sdk.chartjs
```

This shows a working HTML template with `@bonnard/sdk` loaded from CDN and
a Chart.js example. Copy this as your starting point.

## Phase 2: Explore Available Data

Discover what measures and dimensions are available to query:

```bash
# List all views and their fields
bon docs schema

# Query a specific view to see what data looks like
bon query '{"measures": ["view_name.measure"], "dimensions": ["view_name.dimension"], "limit": 5}'

# Or use SQL format
bon query --sql "SELECT MEASURE(total_revenue), date FROM sales_performance LIMIT 5"
```

Ask the user what data they want to visualize. Match their request to
available views and measures.

## Phase 3: Build the HTML File

Create an HTML file that:
1. Loads `@bonnard/sdk` from CDN (see the template from Phase 1)
2. Initializes the SDK with a publishable key placeholder
3. Queries the semantic layer for the data the user wants
4. Renders charts using Chart.js (or another chart library)

Key points:
- The SDK uses `Bonnard.query()` to fetch data from the deployed semantic layer
- Use the view names and measure/dimension names from Phase 2
- The publishable key will be provided by the user or can be created with `bon keys create`
- Keep the HTML self-contained (inline CSS/JS, load libraries from CDN)

Save the file (e.g., `dashboard.html`).

## Phase 4: Preview Locally

Let the user preview the file in their browser before deploying.
They'll need to set a valid publishable key in the HTML first.

```bash
# Create a publishable key if needed
bon keys create --name "Dashboard" --type publishable
```

## Phase 5: Deploy

Deploy the HTML file as a hosted dashboard on Bonnard:

```bash
bon dashboard deploy dashboard.html
```

This will:
- Upload the HTML content
- Assign a slug (derived from filename, or use `--slug`)
- Print the public URL where the dashboard is accessible

Options:
- `--slug <slug>` — custom URL slug (default: derived from filename)
- `--title <title>` — dashboard title (default: from `<title>` tag)

## Phase 6: View Live

Open the deployed dashboard in the browser:

```bash
bon dashboard open dashboard
```

## Iteration

To update the dashboard, edit the HTML file and redeploy:

```bash
bon dashboard deploy dashboard.html
```

Each deploy increments the version. Use `bon dashboard list` to see all
deployed dashboards with their versions and URLs.

To remove a dashboard:

```bash
bon dashboard remove dashboard
```
